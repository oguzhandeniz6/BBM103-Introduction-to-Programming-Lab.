Hacettepe BBM103 - Introduction to Programming Lab. Assignment 2

A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is a health information technology that
provides clinicians, staff, patients, or other individuals with knowledge and person-specific
information, to help health and health care. CDSS encompasses a variety of tools to enhance
decision-making in the clinical workflow. These tools include automatic alerts and reminders
to care providers and patients, clinical guidelines, condition-specific order sets;’, focused
patient data reports and summaries, documentation templates, diagnostic support, and
contextually relevant reference information, among other tools. Robert Hayward of the
Centre has proposed a working definition for Health Evidence: “Clinical decision support
systems link health observations with health knowledge to influence health choices by
clinicians for improved health care”. CDSSs constitute an essential topic in artificial
intelligence in medicine.
This assignment focuses on a probability-based decision system called Doctor’s Aid for
clinicians.
